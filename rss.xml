    <description>So...erm, I was just playing with a Makefile that would deploy
      my website onto the server and all... long story short, I *acidentally* sent an 'rm -rf /*'
      to my server. I know, right. Didn't loose much though. Thank god I keep auto backups on daily.
      The server should be back online within a few minutes.</description>
